### Hello there, I am Umair Durrani

I am a data scientist with a PhD in Civil Engineering. I'm passionate about reducing human error in transportation systems 🚂 ✈️ 🚊 🚗.

By day, I develop shiny apps and do data science at Presage Group. In my free time, I teach data analysis in R workshops, write blogs, and give talks.

#### Recent Projects

- {frstore} R package (Not public yet): An R package that lets you post, update, get, delete, and query Google Cloud Firestore database via {httr2}.
- A [quarto blog](https://itav-ngsim.netlify.app/) that teaches transportation researchers how to import, transform, visualize, and analyze vehicle trajectories data in R, Python, and Julia. The posts in this blog show how to use {arrow}, {tidyverse}, pandas, polars, and Tidier.jl packages for analyzing bigger-than-memory data.
